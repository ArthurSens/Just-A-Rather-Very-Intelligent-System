# Just a rather very intelligent system

Inspired by MCU J.A.R.V.I.S., just a simple chatbot with voice.

Since the beginning of 2019, I've been craving to learn Python. One of the most popular languages, specially to Machine Learning. Something that I knew almost nothing about at the moment that this project was created.

After some tutorials at youtube, I've decided to start this project with the objective of learning Python and Machine Learning.

## Main Goal

Develop a chatbot that is easy to expand with new functionalities without losing precision about what you and Jarvis are talking about.


## RoadMap

* Create module to fully manage one's google calendar with simple human-like conversation
* Create module to ask weather forecasting with simple human-like conversation
* Using ElasticSearch to store module's conversation candidates instead of multiple local JSON files
* Substitute ML technique from Supervised to Reinforcment Learning
