# Just a rather very intelligent system

Inspired by MCU J.A.R.V.I.S., just a simple chatbot with voice.

Since the beginning of 2019, I've been craving to learn Python. One of the most popular languages, specially for Machine Learning purposes. Something that I knew almost nothing about at the moment that this project was created.

After some tutorials at youtube, I've decided to start this project with the objective of learning Python and Machine Learning.

# Main Goals

* Learn Python
* Learn about IoT and IoT Networks
* Learn Machine Learning techniques
* Develop a chatbot that is easy to expand with new functionalities without losing precision about what you and Jarvis are talking about.
* Make the conversation as human like as possible

---

## Secundary goals

* Easy to integrate with IoT devices
* Split Jarvis between multiple microservices
* Create a fully automated devops environment to build and test all microservices
* Use cutting edge cloud native tools, such as Kubernetes, Prometheus and Envoy
* Learn about security and privacy within IoT projects and Software Development projects
* Develop a couple of functionalities with and without IoT devices as examples for future contributions
* Make MCU J.A.R.V.I.S. a real thing :v:

### Currently studing 

* Kubernetes
* Undergraduate thesis -> Create semantic contexts from annotation tools' results (NLP)
* Azure, Google Cloud Platform and other cloud providers
* Circuits, Sensors and Arduino

### Development Live Streaming

* I try to code while live streaming at my [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/arthursens) as often as possible, with the object of engage more people to help me out with this project. I can share a little bit of what I know and viewers can give me some directions about what I could possibly be doing wrong.
